This branch is based on master and disables OP long in favor of stock TSS2 cruise for user selectable follow distance. Note you'll need to do a `gitsubmodule init && git submodule update && scons -j4` to pull submodules and compile before rebooting. Also note that it flashes panda to enable stock ACC message forwarding.
